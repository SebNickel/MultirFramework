MultirFramework for NumberTron
===============

This is a fork of MultirFramework, modified to work as the MultiR dependency for NumberTron.

Some of the classes in this module are copied from yet another version of MultiR, found [here](https://github.com/NEO-IE/MultirExperiments)

[Original NumberTron repository](https://github.com/NEO-IE/numbertron)

[My fork of NumberTron](https://github.com/SebNickel/numbertron)

From the original README:

This is a framework for the Multir Pipeline that handles corpus representation, distant supervision, feature generation, model training, and extraction


Some of the source code comes from Raphael Hoffman's Multir project http://www.cs.washington.edu/ai/raphaelh/mr/index.html
